# Summary of work done

## 19/12

For this date here is a summary of done work, and clues for improvements.

### Work done

The API fetching is done, and a list of search result is displayed.  
CocktailDetails are accessible by clicking a result.  
Objectives are completed but can be improved.

### Improvements

The function to format ingredients of API response can be improved. It's a bit dirty even if functionnal. Removing the 2 arrays at beggining maybe be a solution to make it more readable and comprehensive.

The ScrollView implementation isn't good, i'll need to figure out for a better implementation.

CocktailDetails component can be refactored and improved. For example make a unique component Section for ingredients and recipe could be a good refacto.

Some styles can be improved too.
